# Authentication App using MERN Stack üîë

This is a simple authentication app built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The app allows users to sign up, log in, and log out, with features such as password hashing, JWT token authentication, input validation, and CORS enabled for cross-origin resource sharing.





## Features

- **Sign Up:** Users can create an account by providing a username, email, and password.
- **Log In:** Users can log in to their account using their email and password.
- **Log Out:** Users can log out of their account.
- **Password Hashing:** Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for secure storage in the database.
- **JWT Token Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to authenticate users and authorize access to protected routes.
- **Input Validation:** Input fields are validated to ensure that users enter valid data.

- **CORS Enabled:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled to allow requests from different origins.
